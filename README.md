# Project Objectives

The purpose of this project is to apply and demonstrate my developer skills, specifically using OOP, debugging, refactoring and documentation skills in Java. This Capstone Project also forms part of my developer portfolio. 

In this Capstone Project, I designed a project management system for a small structural engineering company called "Poised" which stores all relevant information
about its projects, constructors, customers and architects. 

This project management system must be able to do the following:

1. Read details about exisiting projects from a text file;
2. Capture details about new projects;
3. Update the due date of existing projects;
4. Update the contractor's contact number or email address of an existing project;
5. Update the project fee paid to date;
6. View completed, incomplete or overdue projects;
7. Finalize existing projects and write finalized projects to a text file.
